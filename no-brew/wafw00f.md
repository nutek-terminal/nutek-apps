# wafw00f

## Description
The Web Application Firewall Fingerprinting Tool. 
â€” From Enable Security

How does it work?

To do its magic, WAFW00F does the following:

Sends a normal HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a number of WAF solutions.
If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious) HTTP requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is.
If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security solution is actively responding to our attacks.
For further details, check out the source code on our main repository.

                        testing on the first one
  -r, --noredirect      Do not follow redirections given by 3xx responses
  -t TEST, --test=TEST  Test for one specific WAF
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        Write output to csv, json or text file depending on
                        file extension. For stdout, specify - as filename.
  -i INPUT, --input-file=INPUT
                        Read targets from a file. Input format can be csv,
                        json or text. For csv and json, a `url` column name or
